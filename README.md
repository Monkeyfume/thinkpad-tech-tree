# thinkpad-tech-tree

`thinkpad-tech-tree.txt` is a plaintext map of all ThinkPad-brand laptops and tablets sold by IBM and Lenovo from 2005 to the present year. It was inspired by the ["tech trees"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_tree) found in some games. Eventually, I aim for this file to include every ThinkPad model since the first in 1992, but making this happen hasn't been easy for me since I am considerably less familiar with the pre-2005 models. Your contributions can help complete the "tree"!

You may notice that this file includes a significant number of spaces. Spaces need to be used instead of tabs to keep compatibility between various editors and viewers, but they do make it annoying to edit something like this. My preferred text editor on Windows is Notepad++; Notepad++ has a feature where all spaces can be converted to tabs and vice versa, which makes it much easier to edit this file in particular. If you want to submit an update, addition, or fix to this file, I highly recommend using Notepad++ or some other text editor that can switch between spaces and tabs.

If your preferred text editor wraps lines and ruins the formatting of `thinkpad-tech-tree.txt`, I recommend you look into my other project, [thinkpad-tech-tree-tall](https://github.com/Monkeyfume/thinkpad-tech-tree-tall) and download the file there.
