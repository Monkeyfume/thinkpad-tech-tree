# thinkpad-tech-tree

`thinkpad-tech-tree.txt` is a plaintext map of all ThinkPad-brand laptops and tablets sold by IBM and Lenovo from 2005 to the present year. It was inspired by the ["tech trees"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_tree) found in some games. I want this file to eventually include every ThinkPad model since the first in 1992, but making this happen hasn't been easy for me since I am less familiar with the pre-2005 models. Your contributions can help complete the "tree"!

You may notice that this file includes a significant number of spaces. If you want to edit it, I recommend using a text editor that can convert between spaces and tabs, such as Notepad++.

If your preferred text editor wraps lines and ruins the formatting of `thinkpad-tech-tree.txt`, I recommend you look into my other project, [thinkpad-tech-tree-tall](https://github.com/Monkeyfume/thinkpad-tech-tree-tall) and download the file there.
